# Codebase Overview: Hello World Go Application

## Project Structure

**Root Files:**
- `main.go`
- `go.mod`
- `go.sum`
- `Dockerfile`
- `.gitignore`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.golangci.yml`
- `Makefile`

**Directories:**
- `cmd/server`: Main server entry point (`main.go`)
- `internal`: Core application logic
- `api`: Contains handlers, API setup, and documentation definitions
- `server`: Server initialization and lifecycle management
- `config`: Environment-based configuration loading
- `test/integration`: Integration tests
- `scripts`: Setup and linting scripts
- `copycmd`: File management utilities
- `bin`: Compiled binaries (ignored by Git)

## Key Functionalities

### Server Setup
- Built using **gorilla/mux** and configured through a builder pattern.

### Environment Management
- Configurable via `.env` file and environment variables.

### Endpoints
- `/health`: Health check endpoint
- `/`: Service status endpoint

## Development & Testing Tools

### Scripts
- `setup.sh`: Installs dependencies and tidies modules
- `check.sh`: Runs linting and tests

### Makefile Tasks
- Automation for testing, building, running, linting, and Docker setup.

### Tests
- Unit tests using **testify** and **httptest**.
- Integration tests ensuring full server lifecycle.

## Build & Deployment

- **Dockerfile**: Multistage build with static binary compilation.
- **Docker-Compose**: Defines a production-ready service with health checks.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Linter, tests, and Docker processes are automated.

## Extensibility Strategy

### Intended Use in Other Applications
- **Modular Service**: The `internal/server` and `internal/api` modules can be used as a foundation for other Go-based microservices.
- **Environment Configuration**: Reuse `internal/config` to load settings dynamically in other projects.
- **API Expansion**: Extend `internal/api/handlers` with additional routes and handlers.
- **Docker Deployment**: Reuse Docker setup for similar containerized deployments.

### How to Extend It
- **Add New Endpoints**: Implement new routes using the builder pattern in `server.go`.
- **Include New Modules**: Follow the modular design pattern to integrate additional functionality.
- **Expand Configurations**: Update `config.go` with more environment variables as needed.
- **Integration Points**: Use the Makefile and Dockerfile as a base for new CI/CD pipelines.

This codebase is designed for maintainability and scalability through well-structured modules, clear service lifecycles, and CI/CD readiness.
