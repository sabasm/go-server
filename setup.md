# Setup and Usage Guide

**CLI Commands for Setup and Usage:**

1. **Run Setup Script:**

   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

3. **Build the Application:**

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

4. **Run Tests with Coverage:**

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

5. **Format the Codebase:**

    ```bash
    make format
    ```

6. **Vet the Codebase:**

    ```bash
    make vet
    ```

7. **Run Linting and Tests Together:**

    ```bash
    make check
    ```

8. **Use Shell Scripts Directly:**

    Check:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/check.sh
    ```

**Insights on Usage and Development in Go:**

Dependency Injection (DI):

Go does not have a built-in DI container. Instead, it encourages manual DI by passing dependencies as function arguments or struct fields.

In the provided setup, the ConfigLoader interface allows for easy substitution of different configuration sources, facilitating testing and scalability.

Project Structure:

The internal directory restricts import access to within the module, promoting encapsulation.

The cmd directory contains the entry point for the application, aligning with Go best practices.

Configuration Management:

Centralized configuration loading via the config package ensures that all parts of the application access consistent settings.

Using environment variables with fallback defaults enhances flexibility across different environments (development, testing, production).

Testing:

Although the current test coverage is low (0.0%), implementing tests for each package and component will improve reliability.

Consider using interfaces and mocking dependencies to facilitate unit testing.

Linting and Formatting:

golangci-lint integrates multiple linters, ensuring code quality and adherence to Go conventions.

go fmt automatically formats code, maintaining consistency across the codebase.

Makefile and Scripts:

The Makefile provides convenient targets for common tasks, streamlining the development workflow.

Shell scripts like check.sh automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

Version Control:

The .gitignore file ensures that unnecessary or sensitive files are excluded from version control, maintaining a clean repository.

Scalability:

By adhering to modular design principles and encapsulating functionality within well-defined packages, the application can scale gracefully as new features are added.

Best Practices for Clean, Scalable, and Modular Go Code:

Encapsulate Functionality:

Use packages to group related code, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.

Interface-Driven Design:

Define interfaces for components to decouple implementations, facilitating easier testing and substitution.

Error Handling:

Handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful messages and avoiding application crashes where possible.

Documentation:

Document packages, functions, and important components using Go's documentation conventions to aid maintainability.

Consistent Formatting:

Rely on go fmt and linting tools to maintain a consistent code style, enhancing readability.

Automate Tasks:

Use Makefile targets and shell scripts to automate setup, testing, building, and deployment processes.

Environment Configuration:

Manage configuration via environment variables and centralized configuration services, enabling flexibility across different deployment environments.

Version Control Hygiene:

Maintain a clean .gitignore to exclude build artifacts, sensitive information, and unnecessary files from the repository.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the provided setup, your Go project will be well-structured, maintainable, and scalable, ready to accommodate future growth and complexity.
